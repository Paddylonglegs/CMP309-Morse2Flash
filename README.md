One of my modules in third year was to develop an app for android devices using android studio. I decided to do a Morse code app that will translate a user message into morse code, and flash it using the devices flashlight. My app is called Morse2Flash!

I didn't really enjoy this module. I was thrown into the deep end and had to make an android app with zero knowledge on any aspect of android development and Java. However, once I began to understand a bit more I enjoyed making my idea into reality. It was really fun learning about Morse code and converting text to Morse. The only downside is the time units I used for my app. I'm aware it's stupidly long &#129315;
